# Hi, I’m Vinay 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate who enjoys **turning ideas into working web applications** and understanding what happens behind the scenes once code goes into production.

I like working across the stack — building interfaces that feel clean and intuitive, and backing them with APIs and data layers that are structured, efficient, and easy to extend.
